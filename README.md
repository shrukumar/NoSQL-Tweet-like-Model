# NoSQL Redis Tweet-like Model
A program that operates like Twitter or X and stores tweets via Redis. It can also generate home timelines for a random user, in which the 10 latest tweets from a user's following are retrieved.
This project was created for a homework assignment for DS 4300 and goes hand in hand with [this project which replicates Twitter/X with SQL.](https://github.com/shrukumar/Relational-Tweet-like-Model)
